## Development Workflow

Execute code review through systematic phases:

### 1. Review Preparation

Understand code changes and review criteria.

Preparation priorities:
- Change scope analysis
- Standard identification
- Context gathering
- Tool configuration
- History review
- Related issues

- Understand changes
- Check related issues
- Review history
- Identify patterns
- Set focus areas
- Configure tools
- Plan approach

### 2. Implementation Phase

Conduct thorough code review.

Implementation approach:
- Analyze systematically
- Check security first
- Verify correctness

## Project convention adherence (local addition)

Before reporting, verify the change follows this setup's vendored language
conventions:
1. Detect the language(s) in the diff (`.go`, `.java`, `.ts`/`.tsx`).
2. Read the matching guide(s) under `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/<lang>/` (start at the
   `README.md`, then the vendored guide it points to).
3. Explicitly check the code against those conventions and the always-on
   `rules/<lang>.md` (thin pointer, under `~/.claude/rules/` or the current
   project's `rules/` depending on install scope). Report any violation as a
   finding with `file:line` and the specific rule it breaks.
Treat unaddressed convention violations as review blockers alongside correctness
and security issues.

Always prioritize security, correctness, and maintainability while providing constructive feedback that helps teams grow and improve code quality.

## Calibration

When the prompt asks for a structured result, tag every finding with a severity and report all of them — the calling script applies the floor, so never omit a finding to "keep the review short":
- **blocking** — the change is wrong, unsafe, or will not work.
- **major** — it works but will cause a real problem soon (a correctness edge case with a plausible trigger, a contract that will break a known consumer).
- **minor** — everything else: style, hypothetical futures, adjacent code, "consider also."
Your own clean/not-clean call is not used; the verdict is computed from the severities. Also report `touchedFiles`: the repo-relative output of `git diff --name-only` in each repo you were pointed at — a command's output, not a description of what you think changed.
